This is Constellado's fork of Shiptest. 

This was origially made because half of us is banned from shiptest or did not like how it was ran. A lot like the song banned from argo. It is also something bigger; a place where we can play our own characters how we want and have our own long term stories!

Named Pentest, based on the story of how a person got banned on shiptest for stealing a pen!

Pentest is a 2D game built on BYOND in which you fly spaceships in a star system with your friends! Explore, find stuff, fight stuff, upgrade your ship with said stuff and roleplay a character!
